I was working at a production company and one day I was handed a camera and told to go shoot Rihanna’s concert in Stockholm. I had no idea what I was doing, but then and there I discovered I had an eye for capturing moments. A year later I moved to LA with my two girlfriends, we would pack our car full of clothes, drive up and down PCH and photograph each other, to then post on our blogs and Instagram. And from there it turned into a career, so it really was a passion that turned into a career.”<\/p><p><strong>How would you describe your aesthetic?<\/strong><\/p><p>The eclectic meets the minimalist.

So I’d pair that with something conceptual and futuristic, like a Sabine Marcelis candy cube or a neon artwork by Dan Flavin. (…) There are things that I love such as how Mexican architect Luis Barragán informs his stark architectural forms with an exuberant fuchsia palette or (…) an eccentric great style of L’Oeil magazine editor Rosamond Bernier. I appreciate the craftsmanship combined with the irreverence of (…) jeweller Joel Arthur Rosenthal, who makes a diamond brooch that looks like a twisted orange peel. (…) I also love the verdant and lush atmosphere of Palacío de Monserrate in Sintra, and the proud but doomed splendour of a film like Visconti’s <em>Il Gattopardo<\/em>. All that amalgamated with the playfulness and surrealism of Carsten Höller’s Upside Down Mushroom Room artwork at the Prada Fondazione and my aesthetic probably lands somewhere bang in the middle. <\/p>",

I love furniture, textures and shapes, accents and the details of great architecture, making my love for Visual spaces ever so strong. My heartfelt devotions for any form of Art forces me to add sculptures, paintings or any details to my decor in order to feel visually satisfied when decorating.  I love to keep my aesthetics simple, elegant but effortless. I don’t use too many colours usually. I keep things rather neutral but use colours seasonally depending on my mood to structure my emotions.  One thing I would say that defines me the most is my ongoing need to move furniture around and redecorate to recreate my inner space. I love redesigning the angles, relocating my energy and giving a new mood to my rooms.\"<\/p>",
