Glass is the most versatile and mesmerizing material that I can think of. The history of how it came to populate almost every aspect of our daily lives goes back to more than 4000 years ago.  In this cold grey month, I would like to shed a bit of light by offering you a flânerie amongst a selection of glass creations that I find compelling.<\/p><p><strong>By Astrid Malingreau<\/strong><\/p>",

One evening as they stopped on the shore of the river Belus (northern Syria) to set camp, they could not find any rocks to rest their cooking pot above the fire and instead used blocks of their own stock. When the nitro started to burn it melted with sand and ran in a liquid stream that later cooled and hardened into glass. <\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p> *Nitro or nitrogen is one of the original raw material used in the composition of glass <\/p>",

Nonetheless, the researches conducted prove that the art of glass was born and refined to an art in this region before it was adopted in Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc.  The technique evolved over hundreds of centuries and today glass can be moulded, blown, cast, and pressed. If you vary the temperature or the composition you will get opaque, transparent, translucent, or colored glass.<\/p><p>My first encounter with the marvellous qualities of glass was in a furnace on the isle of Murano where my parents had brought me as a child. I was taken aback by the transformation of this liquid substance happening before my eyes through the sheer force of the <em>Maestro<\/em>’s breath. The blown glass technique consists in blowing in the liquid through a cane in order to give it the desired shape that can vary from a simple form in a mould to the most intricate sculptures. It dates back to its Syrian beginnings but was developed by the Romans and quickly spread around their immense empire. It is a crucial turning point as it allows quicker and sharper production. <\/p><p>Since the 13th-century glass is at home in Venice where safely placed on the isle of Murano, the Maestri perfected the blowing technique to an art.<\/p>",

In 1960, he arrived in Venice at the age of 24 with a study grant to pursue his interest in colored glass at the Venini glassworks. He was to become a wind of change in the old furnace. Unlike the Italian designers, he saw the glass process with a new eye, questioned the traditional esthetic canons and experimented with techniques. <\/p>",

It was commissioned in 1928 to Pierre Chareau by two clients, Jean Dalsace and his wife Annie. The project might have been different if the owner of the second and last floor apartment had not categorically refused to sell, preventing any changes to that part of the building. Because of this unexpected event Chareau suggested a daring surgical operation to demolish the lower part of the house and replace it with a more contemporary structure including a facade made entirely of glass bricks.
