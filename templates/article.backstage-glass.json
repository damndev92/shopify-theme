Glass is the most versatile and mesmerizing material that I can think of. The history of how it came to populate almost every aspect of our daily lives goes back to more than 4000 years ago.  In this cold grey month, I would like to shed a bit of light by offering you a flânerie amongst a selection of glass creations that I find compelling.<\/p><p><strong>By Astrid Malingreau<\/strong><\/p>",

When the nitro started to burn it melted with sand and ran in a liquid stream that later cooled and hardened into glass. <\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p> *Nitro or nitrogen is one of the original raw material used in the composition of glass <\/p>",
