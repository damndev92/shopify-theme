A young unknown Starck came to America and after 15 days accepted to build the Royalton in New York. A delirious hotel where the French designer subtly blurred conventional decoration with thewitty, ironic and subversive interiors and furniture that made him the icon of postmodern industrial design.Since the beginning of the 20th-century designers and architects have been invited to invest in hotels and insufflate their vision to the interiors. An example that comes to mind is the beautiful Grand Hotel de Tour designed by the champion of modernism Pierre Chareau in 1927. It was envisioned as a luxurious stay with<em>avant-garde<\/em>furniture with shapes that have now become iconic and timeless. <\/p>",
