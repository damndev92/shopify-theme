Hemingway found his inspiration at the terrasse of the <strong>Gritti<\/strong> in Venice (who wouldn’t ??), Arthur Miller had some of his most frenetic breakthroughs at the legendary <strong>Chelsea Hotel<\/strong>, <em>Murder on the Orient Express<\/em> is rumored to have been penned in the room 411 of the <strong>Pera Palace<\/strong> in Istanbul. Perhaps the best example is Vladimir Nabokov who, as soon as he had enough money, moved from America to the <strong>Montreux Palace<\/strong> Hotel Switzerland never to leave again. <\/p><p>If you think about it, hotels are much beyond the daily preoccupations of a tourist, they are situated somewhere between reality and fantasy. Some hotels persuade us that we have not left home, some try to immerse us in a different culture, some try to show us a different kind of life. I have always fantasized about living in a hotel, about the carefree life I would lead far from the domestic concerns, the joy I would experience belonging everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Beware of the coming whirl of dates…<\/p>",

In the 1960s, the hotels were a kind of national calling card allowing a country to show off how avant-garde it was. It was part of the apparatus of an ambitious nation comparable to a pavilion at a World Fair or even nuclear power. Originally known as the <strong>SAS Hotel<\/strong>, the Radisson was commissioned in 1955 to Arne Jacobsen by the Scandinavian Airlines System (a conglomerate of the Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish national airlines) and opened its doors in July 1960. <\/p><p>Thought like a total work of art by Jacobsen who designed not only the building but every interior detail from the light fixtures, the carpets, the dinnerware, etc. It was the birthing project for iconic designs such as the groovy and whimsical ‘egg’, ‘drop’ and ‘swan’ chairs.<\/p>",
