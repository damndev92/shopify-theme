This material seems to have the magic power to express ideas that should be mutually exclusive; modernity and nostalgia, mass production and craftsmanship, sensuality and functionality. The use of metal has also achieved nothing less than turning our esthetic and social convictions upside down.<br\/>The shift from handcrafted wood furniture to metal pieces is pivotal as it meant that well-designed furniture could be reproduced thousands of times and at a reasonable cost. In other words, this switch paved the way for each of us to live comfortably with great works of design that stimulate the same emotions as the original creation. <\/p><p><strong>By Astrid Malingreau<\/strong><\/p>",

At its center, a grand semi-circular desk and an armchair that I had never seen but whose design felt familiar. The<em>Borderel<\/em>desk and armchair were a prototype designed by the Art deco master Jacques Emile Ruhlmann (1879-1933) and entirely made out of<em>Duralium<\/em>(Duralium was originally developed for aviation. It combines the lightness of aluminum and the strength of metal). Ruhlmann was a designer of luxury furniture, known worldwide for his use of opulent materials such as fine woods and  inlaid ivory, far from industrial production. For a design geek like me it was surprising to see his name associated with such a metallic ensemble. I had to investigate.<\/p>",
