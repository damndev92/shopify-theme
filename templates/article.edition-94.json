The vases sold out in less than a week. <\/p><p>Edition 94 was born. <\/p>",

She also started to collaborate with artists to design bespoke pieces for her shop. She noticed that people love table settings and in particular her quirky placemats.<\/p><p>When India sells out she is never in a rush to restock as a lot of her homeware is made by small artisans and work on a different timeline from the big producers. Her aim remains the same: to support artists and champion a certain idea of sustainability with timeless decoration. She is passionate about finding and recycling vintage pieces; “Each piece has a unique story to tell” she told us with a smile. <\/p><p>India also explains that the extraordinary thing about homeware is that you don’t have to just buy expensive and luxury items but that there is beauty as well in the smallest pieces.  <\/p><p>God is in the detail as they say.<\/p>",
