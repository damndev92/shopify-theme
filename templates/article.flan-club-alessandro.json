        "text": "<p>For the past 35 years, hidden within the quiet streets of St. James in London, the bar of the Dukes Hotel, has been home to a Martini so unique it’s actually refered to as the best Martini in the world. The Duke's bar, which was Ian Fleming’s favorite in London, was the first bar in the world to prepare the Martinis in the trolley and to do it with a frozen glass and frozen gin.  Alessandro Palazzi, head bartender since 2007, is some sort of a legend in the bartending world. The “maestro of the martini” talks to us about his career, the magic behind a hotel bar and his favourite James Bond.<\/p>",

But don’t worry I’ve taught the young bartenders to do them too, so It’s not just me.<\/p><p><strong>What is your favorite cocktail?<\/strong><br\/>A gin martini, Manhattan whiskey base or Negroni. They are my three benchmarks when I go to visit a bar.<\/p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your story?<\/strong><br\/>Do you have six hours for this interview? [laughter] I did my first kitchen school in Senigallia, in the region of Le Marche in Italy, where I come from. I went to the United Kingdom in 1975 to learn English. I was too young to work behind the bar, so I started as a kitchen porter and became a barista, making coffee, in a big restaurant. Then I got lucky: the maître d’hôtel noticed me. He recommended me for this 1800 restaurant,  outside London, in a beautiful place near Colburn. Then I was sent to Paris to the Georges V in the ’80s. Initially, it was supposed to be training, but I ended up staying for six years! It was my first palace. There, I became a sommelier bartender. I didn’t have a clue on how to be a sommelier. All I knew was how to open a bottle of Chianti. I didn’t have a clue of what Château Margaux or Petrus was…<\/p>",
