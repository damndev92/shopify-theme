I would say my framed pictures  – I have original Brigitte Bardot images, a limited edition drawing by Luke Edward Hall, a collage from my friend Audrey Guttman, à war picture from Cambodia in 1973 by Penelope Chauvelot, a Peter Lindbergh photo of an angel on a beach, Herbarium pressed flowers –  it’s a real mix of a million things I love.<\/p><p><strong>Your favourite restaurant in the world:<\/strong><\/p><p>The simplest, most chilled yet delicious restaurant is O’Dinis Restaurant in Comporta, on the beach. Grilled sardines, fresh tomato salads, amazing Sangria. I wouldn’t trade this restaurant for anything else in the world. Its simplicity brings you back to basics. If I had to choose one in Paris it would be Le Bar des Prés, rue du Dragon.<\/p><p><strong>Your favourite address for decoration: <\/strong><\/p><p>Barracuda Comporta, based in Carvalhal in Portugal. It’s the coolest shop that has a mix of vintage pieces and their own designs. You always end up seeing Jacques Grange or Pierre Passebon over there, eyeing up the latest pieces.<\/p>",
