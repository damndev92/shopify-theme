I had started narrowing down the concept whilst preparing for the opening of my club at the Chateau Marmont. I delve into what I was known for: my music and my network, something I could do by myself without a physical space or outside investment and involvement. I had a feeling I wanted to narrow things down and Covid was a sign from the universe to get it out.<\/p><p>Spending my evenings at the Chateau Marmont, I often found myself having fascinating conversations and thought, ‘why aren’t I recording these conversations?’ Patti Smith was my first interview.<\/p><p>When Lockdown happened I was incredibly grateful to have this positive, creative outlet. It was an incredible project that I could develop from the comfort of my living room.<\/p>",

But music was always there in our house and for me personally. First it was Persian and Classical music. I was doing mix tapes in primary school and burning CD’s. Then my friend Max Vallot had these turntables at home and I was immediately drawn to them so I decided to save money to buy myself the same ones. To be honest, I’ve never taken it too seriously. Still today, I can’t believe it took me so far. It’s my hobby and I get paid to do it, which is so fun.<\/p>",
