The right firmness can only come from an individual coil system where the coils are first being compressed before they will respond by pushing back up, supporting your lower back still allowing your hips and shoulders to go deeper than the rest of the body, creating an aligned spine and a good sleep posture where the body is in perfect harmony.<\/p><p><strong>Where did you find your inspiration for your Instagram <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/theartreporter\/\"><strong>The Art Porter<\/strong><\/a><strong>?<\/strong><br\/>My father and grandfather were art dealers in Sweden and I have worked with art my whole life in the family business. When I was 21 I wanted to start my own thing so I travelled to NYC in hopes of an art career. Neglected by the gallery assistants in all the white cube-like galleries in Chelsea district I started an art blog with the name Theartreporter.com. The site got popular and I started writing art critic for some of the biggest art magazines in Scandinavia after this.<\/p><p><strong>How would you describe your taste in one word?<\/strong><br\/>Searching.<\/p>",
