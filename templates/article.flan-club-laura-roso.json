Laura is the mother of one-year-old Albert and the founder of the genius second-hand children’s website Kids O’clock. She is the French girl we’ve all dreamed to be, intuitive and witty, effortlessly cool; we were lucky enough to ask Laura about her inspirations, her design addresses, and what she loves in interiors.<\/p>",
