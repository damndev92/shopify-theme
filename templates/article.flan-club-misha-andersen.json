I’m convinced that ‘every interior is a story to be told, every space brings memories, and that uniqueness of great design is to be an inspiration for the ones who enjoy it. Life is full of challenges so why shouldn’t everyone be surrounded by beauty that brings the best of us?  For me it’s Sailing, nature walks, music festivals, Biennale, Art Basel, PAD, Antique exhibitions… Those would be my escapes to recharge and find a new direction.<\/p>",
