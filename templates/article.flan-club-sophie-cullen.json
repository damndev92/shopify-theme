During my first year at uni, I was actually studying Architecture and Interior Design but I ended up moving over to Theatre and Film. When I landed a job as a design journalist in Hong Kong, things kind of came full circle. I found myself traveling across the globe to review hotels and interview the architects and teams behind the properties; it was fascinating.<\/p><p>I then moved to be the Editorial Director of a lifestyle platform across Asia. Hotels weren’t our primary focus, and the idea for a platform that not only reviewed hotels but told the story of their design and designers started bouncing around in my brain. <\/p><p>While I was on reduced hours during COVID, I registered the domain and started working on it a little.  (the irony of launching what is essentially a site dependent on travel was not lost on me, btw!). When my partner was transferred to London, we decided I should focus on it full-time. I’m super lucky that he can support us as the platform grows.<\/p>",
