        "text_block": "<p><strong>Could you please tell us about the Hotel Journal and how the platform started?<\/strong><\/p><p>The Hotel Journal was born out of my love for exceptional interior design, great storytelling, and beautiful hotels. During my first year at uni, I was actually studying Architecture and Interior Design but I ended up moving over to Theatre and Film. When I landed a job as a design journalist in Hong Kong, things kind of came full circle. I found myself traveling across the globe to review hotels and interview the architects and teams behind the properties; it was fascinating.<\/p><p>I then moved to be the Editorial Director of a lifestyle platform across Asia. Hotels weren’t our primary focus, and the idea for a platform that not only reviewed hotels but told the story of their design and designers started bouncing around in my brain. <\/p><p>While I was on reduced hours during COVID, I registered the domain and started working on it a little.  (the irony of launching what is essentially a site dependent on travel was not lost on me, btw!). When my partner was transferred to London, we decided I should focus on it full-time. I’m super lucky that he can support us as the platform grows.<\/p>",

My brother was a pianist and we used to travel a bit as he gave recitals across the country. We were in Christchurch, New Zealand, and we stayed in this beautifully refurbished B&B. My brother and I each had a four-poster bed in our room, and all the furniture and trimmings were so ornate; I felt like I was in a movie!<\/p><p>The Grand Mansion Hotel<\/p><p>From a work perspective, one of my first reviews was for <a href=\"http:\/\/the-grand-mansion-a-luxury-collection-nanjing-nanjing.hotels-nanjing.com\/en\/\">The Grand Mansion Hotel<\/a> in Nanjing, China. The piece of land that the hotel was built on was won in a gambling game. The man who won it wanted to make sure the site was used in a way that gave back to the local community. As they were excavating, they discovered all these antiquities and lost pieces of art hidden in the earth. They decided to use them across the property, making it feel like this glorious hotel\/museum hybrid. The hotel was designed by I.M. Pei’s son, with interiors by HBA, and it has gorgeous views of the Presidential Palace next door. And the most impressive Presidential Suite I’ve ever seen.<\/p>",

        "text_block": "<p> <strong>What makes a good hotel?<\/strong><\/p><p>For me, good design is at the basis of any really great hotel. But design isn’t just about aesthetics. Design also works into how the hotel operates, how the property builds relationships with the neighbouring community. Even what kind of food is put on the menu and where the produce is sourced from they’re all design decisions.<\/p><p>By blending thoughtful design with outstanding service, that’s when you have a really good hotel experience.<\/p><p><strong>How would you define luxury in travel today?<\/strong><\/p><p>Luxury is a tricky word for me. I I found it was really overused when I was living in Hong Kong. There’s an almost obsessive desire for luxury there that made the word feel almost redundant. An all-marble bathroom may be nice in theory, but that’s not real luxury to me. To me, the idea of luxury travel is about bespoke experiences that are more than just skin deep. <\/p><p>I think it’s quite easy to just say a hotel is a ‘luxury hotel’, but when you dig deeper: does it have sustainable design principles in place? Does it work with the community to grow together? Does it offer experiences that both educate and entertain guests? Has it used its locale to inform its design decisions? That’s my idea of luxury. <\/p>",

Overall, people are looking for more boutique and independent properties. They’re probably traveling less, so they’re willing to pay a bit more for something that offers a unique experience.<\/p><p>There are new logistics to consider, which really have sucked a lot of the joy out of travel. Planning a trip these days is kind of like planning a military maneuver, with restrictions and rules changing so rapidly. People are looking for the little extra additions, like being able to have a COVID test done at their hotel to prepare them for their onward journey.<\/p><p>But it’s not all doom and gloom. The increase in eco-friendly properties, the regeneration of areas destroyed by tourism, and hotels that are more socially conscious are some of the positives that we’ve seen come out of the pandemic.<\/p>",

Many hotels like to throw around terms like ‘sustainability, ‘green’, and ‘eco-friendly’, but if you can’t find much information about what they’re actually doing on their website, then I’d steer clear.<\/p><p>That being said, there’s been a huge growth in properties that are very transparent in their practices and they’re the types of places you need to go. The likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bawahreserve.com\/\">Bawah Reserve<\/a> in Bali, <a href=\"https:\/\/fogoislandinn.ca\/\">Fogo Island Inn<\/a> in Canada, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.songsaa-privateisland.com\/\">Song Saa<\/a> in Cambodia really get it right with their holistic approaches to sustainability.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there’s often a financial barrier to staying in properties like these, so on a more universal level, small things like taking your own toothbrush, choosing properties with in-house water filtration systems, opting for plant-based cuisine, requesting that your linens and towels aren’t laundered every day, taking the train instead of a plane, and choosing flights where you can off-set your carbon emissions, are all little things that can help make a difference.<\/p>",
