After purchasing calligraphy tools at a small shop in Paris, her creative focus shifted towards pen, ink, and collage. You may have read about her in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vogue.com\/article\/send-all-of-your-summer-thank-you-notes-on-this-stunning-stationery\">Vogue<\/a>, House & Garden UK or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/story\/stephanie-fishwick-artsy-craftsman-home-charlottesville-virginia\">Architectural Digest<\/a>, or seen her drawings for The Ritz Carlton Champagne Menu; Stephanie Fishwick combines respect for foundations with a rule-breaking spirit to create one of a kind pieces. Today, she lives in a country house in Virginia with her husband and son, her studio, located on the property, respectively surrounded by old ivy-covered cedars, oak trees, hydrangea, boxwood, and magnolias. We had the chance to ask her a few questions.<\/p>",
