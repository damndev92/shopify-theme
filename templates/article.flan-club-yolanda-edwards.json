When I’m doing research before a trip, I get so excited that it’s almost like I’m there (helpful for times like now). I go down so many rabbit holes with all the options of which way to go: I put everything in a notebook and bring it with me—so that if what I’ve mapped out ends up shifting, I have some other options at the ready. <\/p>",
