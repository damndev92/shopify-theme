Rent a car and head off to <a href=\"https:\/\/elevenexperience.com\/deplar-farm-iceland-summer\">Deplar Farm<\/a>, located on Iceland’s Troll Peninsula. Nestled in the Fljot Valley, this lodge has stunning views and seriously good service.<\/p>",

We love Bergsson Mathus for a luxurious brunch or a fresh loaf of bread on the go. Floating in the middle of the Norwegian Sea, Iceland is about as good as it gets when it comes to delicious seafood. Have your fill of the freshest local catch – and maybe even a whale burger – at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiskmarkadurinn.is\/en\">The Fishmarket<\/a>. If you’re looking for something a little more casual, you can’t go wrong with a hot dog from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbp.is\/\">Bæjarins Beztu<\/a>. It may look humble, but we can bet you’ll be going for seconds. <\/p>",

Owned by eight local designers, this shop is a parade of colour, pattern and quirky silhouettes. Music lovers are in for a treat when they come to Iceland. Even if you can’t make it to Iceland Airwaves, you can get a serious earful at <a href=\"https:\/\/12tonar.company.site\/\">12 Tonar<\/a>, Reykjavik’s legendary record store and label.<\/p>",
