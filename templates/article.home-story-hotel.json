        "text": "<p>In a trendy area of downtown Stockholm, bordering two of the destination’s coolest hotspots, <a href=\"https:\/\/storyhotels.com\/\">Story Hotels <\/a>Riddargata is part Scandi dream space, part artsy hipster heaven. Based in a historic building, its 10 rooms have made use of the original brick and concrete – adding an industrial edge to the neutral, chic Nordic design. While organic skincare on tap, an artisanal restaurant and cool cocktail bar tick all the design hotel boxes.<br\/><\/p><p><\/p>",

Their names tell a story – not just of what you can expect in each (The Balcony has, unsurprisingly, a private balcony) but of the type of adventure you’ll have. Whether that be sketching and journaling in The Attic, or cosying up with a new love in The Super Squeeze.<\/p><p><strong>What to expect when staying at Story Hotels, Stockholm?<\/strong><\/p><p>If you’re heading to Stockholm to soak up the best of Scandinavian culture, you won’t be disappointed by the interiors at Story Hotels. Each suite features the classic organic-lined silhouettes you’d expect from Nordic design, along with the pared-back yet cosy design features we fondly refer to as hygge. But this is hygge with a huge difference: it’s been given an industrial injection, through artsy ripped wallpaper, brick, and cool original features like exposed beams and pipes. Along with plenty of art – everywhere.<\/p>",
