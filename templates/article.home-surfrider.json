On a trip to Italy last month, I met a couple that have a collection house in Europe. They have bought arts, antiques and prototypes from designers of the highest calibre, reciting decades of their lives. The mix-and-match of artifacts of the world is just gorgeous, and the stories it told of them even more so. They inspired me so much by being able to harmonise all of this to tell a true story through design. So, to answer your question, I suppose, each project really brings to light its own style icon!<br\/><br\/><strong>Describe your philosophy when it comes to decoration?<br\/><br\/><\/strong>I don’t like the word decoration because it implies you are focusing on the ‘superficial’ or the ‘unnecessary’. I prefer to focus on the essentials – materials, textures and colours, local construction methods. To me, this is what “decorates” a space.<\/p>",
