The decor is a blend of old and new – from Ralph Lauren wallpaper to family heirlooms that have been passed from generation to generation. But don’t just take our word for it. Veronica Grechi’s unique destination, with its 4 jungle-themed suites, has been featured on the cover of Italian Architectural Digest – thanks to its jewel tones and exotic animal prints inside, and its unusual mid-century palazzo building location.<\/p>",

In fact, even the decor has a family feeling – many of the beautiful antiques decorating the 4 rooms are the same pieces Grechi’s grandfather (who owned an antiquity shop) once kept in a secret room in the apartment. His treasures were collected on his travels, from Japan and China, to Europe. And accordingly, every unusual object at Velona’s Jungle has a story to tell – many of the paintings decorating the walls were produced by Veronica’s aunt.<\/p>",

There’s everything from lizard door handles, to a feather lamp and a bathroom ceiling alive with plants in Suite Durrel – built by Veronica’s own mother. While the jungle theme is certainly contemporary, you’ll experience traditional Florence craftsmanship too, as many of the pieces are made by local artisans.<\/p>",
