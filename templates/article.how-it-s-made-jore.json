Josephine’s sense of style always stood out in her native Denmark. Sleek lines, subdued colours and a minimalist bent ruled both in the homes of her friends and the clothes she saw in the streets.<\/p>",

She simply couldn’t connect to the pale hues and raw wood of Scandinavian design; she couldn’t see herself in this version of Nordic interiors. So, when she moved in with her boyfriend, she knew something far more colourful, far more playful would be in order for her own home. And thus the seed for Jore was planted.<\/p>",

At the moment, Josephine can’t get enough of Italian interiors from the 70s and 80s, as well as the playful accent colours of Danish design from the 60s. Josephine adores classic stripes in unconventional colours, so you’ll often see them in the Jore pieces. But interior design isn’t her only inspiration. Inspiration strikes Josephine wherever she goes: the people around her, the clothes her friends are wearing, the hotels she visits on vacation.<\/p>",
