A childhood bedroom in constant state of feng shui (at one point even boasting custard yellow walls!) is testament.<\/p>",

All of that changed, however, back in 2020. A global pandemic hit and life slowed down. Suddenly, she was able to turn a period of stasis into something incredible: the very first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maisonflaneur.com\/product\/amuse-la-bouche-baby-blue-gift-box\/\">Amuse la Bouche napkins<\/a> were sewn.<\/p><p>Creativity often emerges from chaos, and Georgie’s process is no different. Her approach to creation is ever-shifting. She’s still responsible for everything from setting up the business to manning the orders, and seeing the cycle through from start to finish. But, no matter the current approach, it all starts with a drawing.<\/p>",

With a real affinity for natural fabrics, Georgie refused to compromise and use man-made fibres so 100% linen was a true no-brainer. Luckily, it just so happens to be the perfect fabric for her products. Talk about a win-win!<\/p><p>Finding the right suppliers for her gorgeous linen was a lengthy process. She eventually landed on a fantastic linen producer in Belgium who upheld her desire for sustainability for ALB. She sourced eco-friendly dyes and found a team of highly skilled artisans in India who produce each piece by hand in small batches to ensure there’s as little waste as possible.<\/p>",
