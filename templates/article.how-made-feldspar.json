Though the pair had always been incredibly choosey about what they bring into their home, picking only special pieces or items with sentimental value, they weren’t quite as selective when it came to their work.<\/p><p>Jeremy and Cath were frustrated in their careers. They had to make compromises they didn’t want to make and felt unfulfilled. But once they made that move down to Devon – and once that pottery wheel showed up – things started to change. Always preferring to make something rather than buy it, the pair started to really create, to fill their home with want would turn out to be the very first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maisonflaneur.com\/brand\/feldspar\/\">Feldspar<\/a> pieces.<\/p>",

They get most of their inspiration while out walking or from the wonderful illustrations in the children’s books they read to their kiddos. They love to draw a sketch and then try to recreate that pencil sketched object in <a href=\"https:\/\/feldspar.studio\/\">fine bone china<\/a>.<\/p><p>Luckily for them, Devon is really the place to be for a pair of ceramicists. The fine bone china they use comes from Cornwall, and the paper in their packaging is milled in the Lake District. They always try to find local manufacturers for everything as far as they can. Bone china was pretty much a no-brainer when they started to think about their materials, as it’s the strongest ceramic. Its strength allows you to cast it very finely while still ensuring it’s up to the task of everyday life. As it’s a dying craft – there are only a few producers left in the UK – they felt that it was their duty to keep the tradition alive.<\/p>",
