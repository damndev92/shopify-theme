        "text": "<p>Minimalist decor style takes its inspiration from art and architecture. The founders of minimalism were artists – their movement, De Stijl, had simplicity at its core. And the term was later made popular in the 1960s, being used to describe a prominent sculptural style. Now, it refers to one of design’s most popular interior choices – characterised by functional, open-plan spaces. Minimalist homes are pared-back, from their colour palette to the type and volume of furniture used in the space. And even the shapes seen in minimalist homes head back-to-basics: the clean lines of squares, rectangles and geometric patterns are favoured over fancier florals and flowing forms. Minimalist decor is used to create a calming, quiet environment – and this harmony comes courtesy of boundaryless rooms that flow into each other. These open spaces are kept free from clutter – in minimalism, less is definitely more. If you’re looking to create your own zen, minimalist home, the living room’s an easy place to start. And our best tips on how to create a minimalist living room are below, to help you get started.<\/p>",

Think basic shapes like squares and rectangles, and go for styles that follow the format. This<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maisonflaneur.com\/product\/altay-armchair\/\">designer armchair<\/a>has an angular design, in powder-coated metal and leather. A<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maisonflaneur.com\/product\/blue-moon-armchair\/\">mid-century chair<\/a>with metal details is another great option. Or, if you’re looking to add colour to your otherwise muted space, go for an accent chair in one block colour, like this two-part<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maisonflaneur.com\/product\/yellow-lounge-chair\/\">yellow lounge chair<\/a>. when it comes to filling your living room: less is more. Pick one investment accent chair instead of a few smaller ones – you’ll get a chair that makes a bigger style statement, and it’ll give your other furniture more room to breathe.<\/p>",

They make your room more practical, adding to the space’s calm energy without making it feel busy.
