But when they’re not doing the trick, storage boxes and baskets placed on their surface – in styles that suit your interior scheme – are a savvy storage idea. Think of them like functional ornaments: pick tones and shapes that match your decor, and place them decoratively on top of your dresser, counter or chest of drawers. Thistiled Moroccan cabinetis small but mighty, with drawers and doors for tidying away your trinkets. Or, in the kitchen, awoven bread basketis an easy way to save cupboard space, while also adding a pop of colour.<\/p>",

But if you’re picturing walls of stained pine, don’t worry: there are lots of contemporary shelf styles to choose from, like this marble shelf with gold fittings. Hooks – like this jacaranda hook, or Moroccan copper hanger – are a great option in bedrooms and offices, making an ideal storage solution for hats, scarves, bags and umbrellas. And by using your walls for storage instead of your floor, you’ll be adding functional personality to your room without it feeling smaller.<\/p>",

Designer dinnerware, like these handmade pink dinner plates or handmade yellow ceramic cups, was made to be on display – which means you can stack them neatly in a plate rack or mug tree on your counter without spoiling your kitchen’s overall appearance. And as a bonus, it’ll leave you with much more space in your cupboards for less sightly items. Or, pick storage pieces that match your other objects – like this blue and gold storage pot paired with blue and gold plates – so that your on-display dishes become a style statement.<\/p>",
