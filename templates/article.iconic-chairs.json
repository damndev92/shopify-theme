These are so rare, in fact, that only a handful have come up to market in the decades since it was first created.

Simple, yes, but oh so powerful, the Jeanneret chairs are infinitely covetable. They go with just about every style of interior and stand out amongst their mid-century counterparts for their stoic sturdiness.<\/p>",

Like many of his generation, functionality was placed at the forefront of design, with aesthetics following closely after. That’s not to say his pieces weren’t beautiful. Quite the contrary, in fact. He implemented his hierarchy of materials in creating his chairs, choosing specific materials for specific locations. Armchairs in the boardroom of the Postparkasse, for example, were made of beechwood-stained mahogany with brass accents, while those for directors were subtler with a grey stain and aluminium mounts. So, for Wagner, form really must follow function.<\/p>",
