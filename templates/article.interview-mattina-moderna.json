        "text_block": "<p>After 10 years of a fast Parisian life, I wanted to catch my breath, to \"go home\" to develop a personal project, without pressure to succeed or be productive. I was already working in design and had always been independent.<\/p><p>Returning to my home town - Nice - in 2020, I continued the project I had created several years ago, while nurturing the desire to start from scratch and spend more time with my family. <br\/><br\/><\/p><p>My mother also had a full-time job, but she always dreamed of having her own space to express her creativity and experiment. She loves to find beautiful vintage pieces and rework them to give them a second life. It was only natural that after a few months, we created mattina moderna together. First by offering upcycled pieces, then by working hand in hand with local artisans to create unique pieces.<br\/><br\/><\/p><p>Last June we launched our first ever limited edition capsule. We are now about to launch our 3rd collection. It's pretty crazy!<\/p>",

However, it was not exactly what we wanted. <br\/><br\/><\/p><p>I wanted something more radical, closer to our 3D rendering. I wanted the pieces to be calibrated, the patterns sharp, the colours bold and vivid. A friend recommended a family workshop in Portugal, an emblematic place for ceramics. <br\/><br\/><\/p><p>Today we are very proud to highlight the origin of our pieces. <\/p><p>The ceramics are Portuguese, the lampshades are French, our technical parts are made in Italy, and all this beauty is assembled here in Nice by my mother. <\/p>",
