Nature, Design, Food, People. <\/p><p><strong>Hospitality is part of your heritage – Can you tell us about the story of Cretan Malia Park? <\/strong><br\/>Indeed it is. We grew up in hotels, as our father was amongst the pioneers of tourism in Crete. He was an educated visionary who helped shape quality tourism. Originally a camping site, Cretan Malia Park sits today amongst lush gardens which date back to the late 70’s. The wild Cretan, and in specific Malian flora, with palm trees, Indian figs, and the famous banana trees, are part of beautiful exotic Mediterranean gardens that remain until today a strong reference point and a source of inspiration for its architecture and style. Our paternal grandmother had a successful woven textile business in the 50’s and 60’s, items from her collection are blend in with new design items at CMP to create this fresh yet rooted aesthetic.<\/p>",

The resort’s original form provided the initial idea to create spaces where people will experience the outside, inside. Indoor and outdoor living should blend in a harmonious and natural way for people to experience a new slow-paced lifestyle and authentic unassuming luxury.   <\/p><p>The low rising building’s complex and the amazing gardens, is a sweet spot between the sense of memory and the familiar. This inspired the architect to keep the design rooted in tradition but yet unique, filled with materials, textures, colors of the Cretan land, curious objects, carefully curating a warm atmosphere that will seduce and enchant the visitors<\/p>",
