Your home is the only place in the world that you can truly be yourself and it should honour you and your personality. People will always have opinions and there is no point in mocking or lecturing about what constitutes as good or bad taste. I can share what I would personally find aesthetically displeasing, for example a wrong colour choice or an uncomfortable pattern combination, cheesy art, over the top furniture and ornaments, the list could go on forever! You can overload a room with too many stunning items which will constitute as ”bad taste”. Good taste to me is about finding a balanced medium within your home decor, being sure not to overload and not to be too minimalistic, investing in timeless pieces that will never go out of fashion. But again, it all is in the eye of the beholder!<\/p>",
