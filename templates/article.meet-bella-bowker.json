I love food and drink – my first napkin set was a set of vegetables – so I take lot of inspo from things I eat. <\/p><p>2. I’m a born-and-bred South Londoner<\/p><p>3. Sunshine fills me with so much joy – I think it’s the route to all happiness. <\/p><p><strong>What is the story behind Sew Bella?<\/strong><\/p><p>I broke my leg in my first year at university, and was on crutches for about 5 months. Bored rigid and needing a creative outlet, I picked up a needle and found a passion! I wanted to find a way of adding some fun personality to a tabletop – all the napkins I had found previously felt a bit antique-y, old-fashioned or super plain and drab – and from this Sew Bella was born. <\/p>",

One was a beer delivery subscription service, and the other was a clean air technology company.  <\/p><p><strong>What’s the funniest thing someone ever commissioned?<\/strong><\/p><p>There’s honestly been so many! Some of them are super niche; I spent last week recreating the infamous Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival. The funniest probably has to be a white cat on a white napkin, which really challenged my stitchin’ abilities. <\/p><p><strong>What is your dream commission?<\/strong><\/p><p>My absolute dream is a fully foodie\/drinkie commission. I love creating little miniatures of branded products – it’s fascinating to try and bring in the ‘brand’ in such a tiny space. I recently embroidered a packet of Walkers crisps which was amazing<\/p>",

My appreciation of a house vs a home has dramatically changed over the past year – where I would have used my house as a base for sleeping, slow evenings and lazy weekends, I now actively try and make sure it’s the most homely, welcoming and lovely place to spend time in. The same for the tables – not being able to eat out meant that we had to create our own ‘occasions’ – although I think this will really come into its own as people begin to host again. <\/p><p><strong>What are your tips for the perfect table setting?<\/strong><\/p><p>Let your personality shine! Whatever that may be, there’s nothing more satisfying than looking at a table and thinking ‘that’s a bit of me’. For me, I wear excessively colourful clothing, I love bright and structural flowers, and pattern-clashing makes me happy – so I will always try and top the table with some fabulous florals, a bright and funky tablecloth, quirky plates – and of course, a set of jazzy Sew Bella napkins. <\/p>",
