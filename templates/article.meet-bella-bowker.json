I love food and drink – my first napkin set was a set of vegetables – so I take lot of inspo from things I eat. <\/p><p>2. I’m a born-and-bred South Londoner<\/p><p>3. Sunshine fills me with so much joy – I think it’s the route to all happiness. <\/p><p><strong>What is the story behind Sew Bella?<\/strong><\/p><p>I broke my leg in my first year at university, and was on crutches for about 5 months. Bored rigid and needing a creative outlet, I picked up a needle and found a passion! I wanted to find a way of adding some fun personality to a tabletop – all the napkins I had found previously felt a bit antique-y, old-fashioned or super plain and drab – and from this Sew Bella was born. <\/p>",

One was a beer delivery subscription service, and the other was a clean air technology company.  <\/p><p><strong>What’s the funniest thing someone ever commissioned?<\/strong><\/p><p>There’s honestly been so many! Some of them are super niche; I spent last week recreating the infamous Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival. The funniest probably has to be a white cat on a white napkin, which really challenged my stitchin’ abilities. <\/p><p><strong>What is your dream commission?<\/strong><\/p><p>My absolute dream is a fully foodie\/drinkie commission. I love creating little miniatures of branded products – it’s fascinating to try and bring in the ‘brand’ in such a tiny space. I recently embroidered a packet of Walkers crisps which was amazing<\/p>",

I also love the Mimosa napkin set as it combines several different <strong>stitches. <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Is there something about your embroideries people might not know about?<\/strong><\/p><p>They are so time consuming to create! Not only are they hand-made by a lovely lady in Greece, each one is lovingly designed & stitched – I think there’s around 500 individual stitches of thread in each design. <\/p>",
