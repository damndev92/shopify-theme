They then started looking for artisans in Spain to create bespoke pieces for these projects. While working together on the renovation of the Park Gstaad Hotel, the client asked them last minute to set up a small shop in the hotel’s lobby and the products we designed were such a success that we decided to start producing them in limited quantities! That’s how Studio Erhart was born!<br\/><strong><br\/>How would you describe Studio Erhart in a word?<\/strong><\/p><p>Timeless.<\/p>",
