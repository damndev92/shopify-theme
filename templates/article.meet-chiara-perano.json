Discover the limited edition prints here: Ciao Chiara x Maison Flaneur. Chiara Perano-Sotnyk is an English-Italian artist based in London. Using dark ink, she designs honest, one-of-a-kind illustrations. Finding inspiration from romantic Italian nostalgia, Chiara lets us travel from the comfort of our own home. Her work has ranged from book writing (Nib + Ink, 2016), designing tiles and lettering;  She is currently working on her new passion project, her own home in East London. While she collaborates with select brands and works on artistic commissions, Chiara is also balancing the art of motherhood, a journey that she graciously expresses through her craft. <\/p>",
