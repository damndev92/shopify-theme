It is a moment of disconnection where there is nothing more than a brush, a plate and a lot of imagination.<\/p><p>Since I was little, I have always loved everything that’s handmade. I pay attention to details and I like everything that’s unique; made with love. In fact, whenever I see something that I like I try to do it at home.<\/p>",

We wanted to find a way to make that moment more enjoyable, so our passion for everything handmade and my free time led me to try new things. The first thing I made was a salad bowl, and seeing the success among our friends, we decided to try new things.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Can you tell us about your technique?<\/strong><\/p><p>I just take a brush, mix paint pigments with different oils, and let my imagination flow. All our pieces are hand painted one by one. It’s a very slow process but the final result is worth it! There are not two identical drawings and all the small differences make each piece unique.<\/p>",
