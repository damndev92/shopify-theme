It is a moment of disconnection where there is nothing more than a brush, a plate and a lot of imagination.<\/p><p>Since I was little, I have always loved everything that’s handmade. I pay attention to details and I like everything that’s unique; made with love. In fact, whenever I see something that I like I try to do it at home.<\/p>",

We wanted to find a way to make that moment more enjoyable, so our passion for everything handmade and my free time led me to try new things. The first thing I made was a salad bowl, and seeing the success among our friends, we decided to try new things.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Can you tell us about your technique?<\/strong><\/p><p>I just take a brush, mix paint pigments with different oils, and let my imagination flow. All our pieces are hand painted one by one. It’s a very slow process but the final result is worth it! There are not two identical drawings and all the small differences make each piece unique.<\/p>",

We are surprised and at the same time very excited. We do not sell anything that we are not passionate about, but we did not expect that others would like it as much as we do. What started as a hobby during lockdown has turned out a lot bigger than expected. <\/p><p><strong>Do you use Instagram a lot for inspiration?<\/strong><br\/>The truth is no. What makes the platera unique is that all the designs are inspired by things that surround me. I have my phone full of screenshots, but the funny thing is that none of them are dishes. Most inspo are of other things, like colored geometric images.<\/p>",

Sometimes the most unexpected is what turns out best!<\/p><p><strong>Fishes, Mushrooms, what’s next? What are the next designs you’d love to do?<\/strong><br\/>Secrets can’t be told, as I want to keep on surprising : )  I think there are endless possibilities to be done, from more realistic drawings to completely abstract designs. But if I have to give a hint, they will not be boring!!<\/p><p><strong>Any wishes for 2021?<\/strong><br\/>To be able to keep doing what we love. We wish to continue adding a touch of fun and color to the tables around the world.<\/p>",
