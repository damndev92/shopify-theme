It is a moment of disconnection where there is nothing more than a brush, a plate and a lot of imagination.<\/p><p>Since I was little, I have always loved everything that’s handmade. I pay attention to details and I like everything that’s unique; made with love. In fact, whenever I see something that I like I try to do it at home.<\/p>",
