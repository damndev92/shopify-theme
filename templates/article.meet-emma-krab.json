Lately, I have been very inspired by Bloomsbury interior and the Dries van Noten store in Paris.<\/p><p><strong>If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would you pick and why?<\/strong><\/p><p>Definitely Paris, Itâ€™s my favourite city.

Iâ€™m quite emotional about the things I surround myself with. I would definitely bring the benches my sister Agnes has made for me, they are irreplaceable to me.<\/p><p>But I would also bring the plates my sister-in-law made for my wedding. She made a set of 5 cake plates, with details from the wedding invitation she made us.<\/p><p><strong>Where do you shop for homeware in Copenhagen?<\/strong><\/p><p>Well, most of the items in my home are of course from Jore Copenhagen where I work. Otherwise, I love buying little items at Beau Marche on Ny Ã˜stergade, or Dora on VÃ¦rnedamsvej. Mother on BlaagÃ¥rdsgade has really good second-hand pieces, I bought a really cute ceramic chicken for salt there a while ago.<\/p>",

Itâ€™s not the end of the world if itâ€™s not gonna last forever. To me it helped a lot that all the colours are from the same colour card from Notes of Color. All the colours had a similar vibe in a way, so I could find the colours that were the biggest contrast to each other.<\/p><p>And go with the vibe of the room. If you mainly spend your evenings in the room you can go a bit darker than the rooms you work or cook in.<\/p>",
