And otherwise I often fall in love with interior in movies, Wes Anderson and Midsomer Murders are huge inspo places. Lately, I have been very inspired by Bloomsbury interior and the Dries van Noten store in Paris.<\/p><p><strong>If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would you pick and why?<\/strong><\/p><p>Definitely Paris, It’s my favourite city. Grocery shopping is so much more fun there, people are really nice, and there’s just so much to do.<\/p>",

I’m quite emotional about the things I surround myself with. I would definitely bring the benches my sister Agnes has made for me, they are irreplaceable to me.<\/p><p>But I would also bring the plates my sister-in-law made for my wedding. She made a set of 5 cake plates, with details from the wedding invitation she made us.<\/p><p><strong>Where do you shop for homeware in Copenhagen?<\/strong><\/p><p>Well, most of the items in my home are of course from Jore Copenhagen where I work. Otherwise, I love buying little items at Beau Marche on Ny Østergade, or Dora on Værnedamsvej. Mother on Blaagårdsgade has really good second-hand pieces, I bought a really cute ceramic chicken for salt there a while ago.<\/p>",
