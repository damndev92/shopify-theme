Initially from handmaking napkins with a distinct ruffle at home which captured the hearts of the Instagram audience. The name originated from this design and is a play on words from the small bites preceding the main course in fine dining! We wanted to create a brand that revolves around homeware that lasts beyond seasonal trends, along with the use of high-quality materials our aim is that every ALB product will be loved for many years. We now make our products in small quantities with artisan suppliers abroad as well as collaborating with local seamstresses in the UK.<\/p><p><\/p>",
