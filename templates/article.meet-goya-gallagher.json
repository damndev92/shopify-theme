        "text": "<p>We are so happy to welcome Malaika on Maison Flâneur. Malaika was founded in 2004 by Margarita Andrade and Goya Gallagher who, after growing up in their native Ecuador, found themselves living and settling in Egypt. With a background in design and a keen interest in embroidery, crochet, and hand-drawn thread work, they decided to utilise Egyptian cotton to produce high-quality bed linen previously not available in the local market. At the heart of its business model, Malaika focuses on teaching hand embroidery to local women giving them a chance to learn a valuable skill and improve their economic standing. We sit down with Goya to discuss everything Malaika.<\/p>",

The vibrancy of Cairo, the infinite layers of history, the magic of the desert and the welcoming nature of Egyptians, were impossible to resist! Goya set up a magazine in Cairo and a few years later Margarita, her childhood friend, came to visit and also fell under the spell of Egypt. Malaika started a few years later when it became apparent that the producer of the best cotton in the world, was exporting most of its crops and had no homegrown brand.<\/p>",

We started with one room and women arrived by word of mouth and soon enough, we were looking for a bigger space. As we grew, so did the training program and in 2018 we decided to establish Threads of Hope as an independent embroidery school that could cater to more women.<\/p><p>At Threads of Hope, we teach hand embroidery to hundreds of talented Egyptian and refugee women. Regardless of their age, background, or literacy, here they receive a free two-month education in embroidery and are enabled to pursue and cultivate their individual talents. Once proficient, the women leave the centre and return to work from home. Enter Threads of Hope and you will find a colourful place where women from different countries bring their style and identity, where you will hear different languages and lots of chatter and laughter. These are women that are incredibly resilient and at Threads of Hope we want to offer them a haven, where they can learn a skill, feel respected and valued, where they can safely share their stories, and offer one another hope. <\/p>",

Rose’s husband stayed in Sudan when she fled to Egypt four years ago with their seven children to escape the civil war. Now, as a single mother in Cairo, Rose’s children rely on her being at home. Rose joined the Malaika training centre (TOH) in 2018 and studied embroidery. With needle, thread and yarn, she has acquired the skills to work from home while supporting her family as a mother. Rose says the training centre gave her the means and self-respect to make a life for herself and her family in Egypt. Even though she now embroiders from home, Rose often returns to the centre to spend time with the ladies still working there. The laughter, conversation and family atmosphere bring her back, she says. Rose says she is now proud to be passing on her embroidery skills to her little daughter who is already showing considerable talent and promise at needlework.<\/p>",

For us the beauty of hand embroidery is that no two pieces will ever be identical and that the imperfections are part of the charm. At Threads of Hope, the embroidery school founded by Malaika, embroidery is also community building giving our students an opportunity to share their stories while sitting around an embroidery table. <\/p><p><strong>Where do you find your inspiration?<\/strong><\/p><p>The rich and layered heritage of Egypt is an infinite source of inspiration; from the sumptuous colours and pictorial traditions of Ancient Egypt and charming Coptic tapestries to the intricate patterns of the Fatimid and Mamlouk era, Egypt is a wealth of design resources.<\/p>",
