I had to decided to take a new direction with The Dot Project focusing on exhibitions with a more focused group of Artists and looking at exhibiting their works in a more residential setting. I had to come up with a new way to utilising the large space the Gallery had been running out of and interiors had always been a huge part of my life. I studied Architectural Interior Design at The Inchbald School of Design before opening The Dot Project and opening an interiors store felt like a great way to complement what we had already achieved with The Dot Project. Art and interiors are intrinsically linked and itâ€™s been wonderful to see how the Gallery and the store have worked together.<\/p><p><strong>What does the name refer to?Â <\/strong><br\/>I really saw The Edition 94 is an edition of my first business and the store is located at number 94 Fulham Rd ðŸ™‚<\/p><p><strong>Can you tell us three facts about yourself?Â <\/strong><br\/>I love being by the water â€“ even if we decide to live in London for the foreseeable future I would love to live by the river and retire by the Sea!<br\/>I love Formula One<br\/>My favourite food is Indian<\/p>",
