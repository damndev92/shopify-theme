It proved rather more difficult than I had anticipated, and after ten-week course, I haven’t got much further than hello\/merhaba!<\/p><p><strong>What is the story behind your brand?<\/strong><\/p><p>For as long as I can remember I have loved designing and making things and I always planned to one day turn this creativity into a brand. Both my mother and grandmother are artists and so I was lucky enough to grow up watching and learning so much from them both. I began by making furniture in my parent’s shed for a few years before branching out into designing my own homeware pieces. I launched Issy Granger in 2019 with the aim of creating unique designs that I love and that will bring joy into the home.<\/p>",
