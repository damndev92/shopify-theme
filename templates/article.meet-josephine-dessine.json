Delightful. I had a bit of a panic and my mother handed me a stack of plates and told me to just draw. I drew from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed. Dessine means draw, every time someone would ask for me, my family would go: “Josephine Dessine” meaning Josephine’s Drawing. My mother sat next to me and she taught me what she knew. Then people saw what I was doing and started wanting some, so I kept going. Here we are!<\/p>",
