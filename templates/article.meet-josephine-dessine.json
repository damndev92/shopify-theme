Delightful. I had a bit of a panic and my mother handed me a stack of plates and told me to just draw. I drew from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed. Dessine means draw, every time someone would ask for me, my family would go: “Josephine Dessine” meaning Josephine’s Drawing. My mother sat next to me and she taught me what she knew. Then people saw what I was doing and started wanting some, so I kept going. Here we are!<\/p>",

Is that intentional? <\/strong><\/p><p>My work doesn’t intentionally set out with a political agenda but I am told that portraying women as in charge of their own nudity and sexuality is political. So I choose to hold a sense of humor about it all. I am curious about how women are portrayed, how they celebrate one another, how they exist outside of the male gaze. I like this idea of employing a hyper-feminine style to explore empowerment.<\/p>",

The collection celebrates that. It started as me thinking about iconic moments in history and I came across the photo of the sailor kiss from 1945. Taken at the end of WW2 as they celebrated their return,  I thought to myself what greater joy than the snog the person you love after such a terrifying time. I think there are some parallels with today’s Covid crisis, I look forward to a time where we can once again snog freely!<\/p>",
