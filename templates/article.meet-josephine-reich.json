But I got the urge to design more interiors. I quit my job in August 2020. It was time to go all-in with JORE and design more items. I always design with the heart.<\/p><p>The most important thing is that I love the items – and then I hope that others like them too. My passion is to make products you will love and own for a long time. I want the JORE universe not to be perfect, but that the imperfect becomes perfect.  My motto is: Be yourself!<\/p>",
