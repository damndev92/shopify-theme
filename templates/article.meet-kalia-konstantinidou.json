Antonis was in the family shipping business at the time and I was working in PR for a think tank. On one of my husband’s countless trips to Santorini, he decided to buy a rustic vineyard as his family’s summer estate. He then had the bold idea of turning it into the first 5-star hotel of the island, the now renowned Vedema, a Luxury Collection Resort.<\/p>",

She’s had a very interesting life and many stories to tell. When she was 16, the King of Greece had organized a big ball in the palace. She could attend it because her father worked for the king as he was in charge of the horses. The King of Jordan, who was 50 years old at the time, fell in love with her and wanted to marry her. Of course, he had many wives but that wasn’t an issue. Her mother wanted to let her marry him but her father did not accept it. The pushy king was chasing her, so her father arranged a passport for her to enable her to travel around the Mediterranean. For four years she traveled to Turkey, Israel, Morocco, and Italy so that the king could not find her and that’s how she ended up in Italy and she stayed there.<\/p>",

Both islands boast exquisite natural beauty, rich culture, and gastronomy, and yet they are very unique and with a completely different vibe from each other. The volcanic landscape of Santorini on the one side is a major attraction because of its energy and mystery. A massive explosion that happened thousands of years ago at the Aegean sea, created the biggest Caldera in the world, now offering an amazingly beautiful scenery with breathtaking views – mostly famous for the sun-bleached houses hanging from the cliff, blue-domed churches, and legendary sunsets. On the other side, Paros is a place where unspoiled natural beauty and the slowed rhythms of Cycladic life prevail, the island embodies an authentic and organic Greek experience. The younger crowds come looking for a laidback holiday among its pristine sandy beaches and lively nightlife. Surfers come for its inviting waves, while families enjoy its many shallow, sheltered bays. Couples relish the picturesque villages and bougainvillea-lined alleyways. And nature lovers come to explore the island’s wildlife and stunning geological formations.<\/p>",

This long-forgotten story became the spark of inspiration for a collection of different ideas and images throughout the hotel, the most compelling of which is the arched entryways of the ground floor suites, decorated with water troughs and horse bridles, so reminiscent of the house and stables that used to stand there.<\/p><p>Another very interesting detail that few know is that in our effort to make the spaces as natural as possible, we have used in our spa actual black-volcanic sand from our beach on Perivolos.<\/p><p>Our interior architect has drawn inspiration from the surrounding nature for the design of Parīlio and most notably from the Koukounaries hill where one of the most ancient and important acropoleis of the Aegean was discovered. This pure piece of land inspired the Parīlio colour palette and this is notably reflected on the two rocks highlighting the impressive pool of the hotel. Moreover, the cross that the pool shapes is perfectly aligned with the main entrances of the hotel as well as the hill in the background.<\/p>",

A deserted private residence neighboring a deep blue patch of the Aegean Sea that we transformed to a boutique hotel, aiming to form a new residential experience. The spaces are enhanced with an amalgamation of new and old materials and were intended to make guests feel as if they are living in an authentic Santorinian mansion, reminiscing the estate that once stood in its place.<\/p><p>For Parīlio, we were influenced by the traditional houses of Paros as well as the bright Cycladic sunlight and inspired by the local fortresses – like monasteries that one encounters on the island. The reception area, the first image that is captured by the visitor’s eye, a modern sanctuary with narrow windows and a large entrance that is distinguished by a series of impressive arches, offers an overwhelming feeling of complete calmness. These images create a sense of time travelling to past decades, when life on the Cycladic islands was as pure as light itself.<\/p>",

Lefkes was the island’s first capital and the history there appears frozen in time, with rickety tavernas, leaning houses, and winding marble-paved streets and alleys all surviving and thriving centuries on.<\/p><p>My happy place in Santorini is Megalohori. This is where my family’s house is located. An unspoiled, traditional little village where life has changed very little throughout the years. It’s a carefree place where children can play in the streets and every neighbor is a friend. I also adore Perivolos beach. For Greeks, summer means lying on the beach, basking in the warm summer sun, and swimming in the cool waters of the Aegean. Perivolos beach, with its volcanic black sand and crystalline sea, is all that and more.<\/p>",
