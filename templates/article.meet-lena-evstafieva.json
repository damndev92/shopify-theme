We sit down with Lena to hear more about her incredible project.<\/p>",

My family purchased it and for a while we were not sure what to do with it. My husband and I both worked in the creative industries before, and so the idea of combining hospitality with an artist residency seemed like a good one. The estate is a beautiful natural woodland, and it also seemed very organic to set up vegetable gardens and other agriculture to accompany the restaurant.<\/p><p><strong>Were you always working in hospitality?<\/strong><\/p><p>No, never. VillaLena is my first foray into hospitality. Prior, I worked with contemporary art.<\/p><p><strong>How did you come across this property?<\/strong><\/p><p>My family found it actually and fell in love. I can see why though – the beautiful 19th century villa with bright terracotta walls and peach columns against the verdant green and blue skies really is a stunner.<\/p><p><strong>How would you describe the atmosphere at VillaLena?<\/strong><\/p><p>Friendly and flexible. I would like to think we are very different from other hospitality places where the culture is more set in place – whilst we are always a changing, breathing project, always full of creative and experimental things.<\/p>",

We start by reviewing the applications we have received internally. From there, we make a long list and conduct Skype interviews. Following that, we create a shortlist that goes to our advisory board. After they have issued their recommendations, we have our final list!<\/p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about the residency?<\/strong><\/p><p>The idea behind the residency was to create an open and democratic space, a place of exchange, and collaboration. This is why the residency is multi-disciplinary and we welcome anyone and from anywhere as long as they are committed deeply to their chosen discipline.<\/p><p><strong>Do you have a favourite spot at the hotel?<\/strong><\/p><p>I have quite a few. The Light & Rain Pavillion is a beautiful space, combining the old Roman tradition of oculus with Eastern asthetic of a zen garden, or the top of the mound in the medieval park of Toiano Vecchio with the best views of Tuscany.<\/p><p><strong>An object that you particularly love?<\/strong><\/p><p>Our striped pool umbrellas!<\/p><p><strong>A fun fact about VillaLena?<\/strong><\/p><p>Our truffle dog Igor is very bad at finding truffles but very good at stealing croissants from guests’ breakfast tables<\/p><p><strong>Who would be your ideal guest at VillaLena?<\/strong><\/p><p>Anyone and everyone.<\/p>",
