My family purchased it and for a while we were not sure what to do with it. My husband and I both worked in the creative industries before, and so the idea of combining hospitality with an artist residency seemed like a good one. The estate is a beautiful natural woodland, and it also seemed very organic to set up vegetable gardens and other agriculture to accompany the restaurant.<\/p><p><strong>Were you always working in hospitality?<\/strong><\/p><p>No, never. VillaLena is my first foray into hospitality. Prior, I worked with contemporary art.<\/p><p><strong>How did you come across this property?<\/strong><\/p><p>My family found it actually and fell in love. I can see why though – the beautiful 19th century villa with bright terracotta walls and peach columns against the verdant green and blue skies really is a stunner.<\/p><p><strong>How would you describe the atmosphere at VillaLena?<\/strong><\/p><p>Friendly and flexible. I would like to think we are very different from other hospitality places where the culture is more set in place – whilst we are always a changing, breathing project, always full of creative and experimental things.<\/p>",
