We built it from scratch; there was nothing there. I’ve done everything in the property, every inch, from the architecture to the interior design.” She continues with a smile.  “A few kilometers away from the center of Marrakech, the terrain expends over three hectares. We have an extraordinary garden: the 635-century-old palm trees are one of the main reason why we fell in love with the area. It’s not only an incredibly dense Palmeraie, but it also has a unique topography, as it’s not completely flat.”<\/p>"

I am made of multiple origins myself (Meryanne was born in Cote’ d’Ivoire to a Senegalese diplomat father and West Indian lawyer mother. She spent her early childhood in Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, London and Moscow before settling in Paris), and Morocco historically embodies the crossroad of influences. I think that’s the reason why foreigners feel so welcome here. The first house I did in Morocco was in 1986, and I’ve since then built strong relationships with local artisans. What I enjoy is that here, everything is possible: You draw sketches in the morning, and the next day the ironworker comes up with the model. There are infinite ways to be creative. Morrocan craft allows you to create unlimited bridge and bounds: freedom to create your own satellites.”<\/p>"
