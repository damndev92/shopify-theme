Still family-owned, for 5 generations now, and run today by CEO Michel Bernardaud, whom we were lucky enough to sit with to discuss all things porcelain and their cheeky collaboration with Beefbar.<\/p>",

The brand has always striven for excellence, quality, and extreme precision. Working in a field that is perpetually evolving, Bernardaud remains in the elite of design and innovation, developing technologies that push back the technical limits of the art of porcelain making. <\/p><p><strong>Can you define French Excellence? <\/strong><br\/>Know how, talent, creativity, innovation, elegance.<\/p><p><strong>What is so special about Porcelain? <\/strong><br\/>It is absolutely unique and beautiful. Porcelain has been called “White gold” for centuries and the reasons are that among the family of ceramics (terra cotta, earthenware, stoneware, bone china) it is the only one that can withstand a firing at 1400C giving it unique qualities that are: hard, white, thin, translucent, sonorous and inalterable. <\/p>",

Flowers and candles add refinement. A well-dressed table makes you confident that the meal is going to be joyous and delicious. I have been told in my childhood that when seated around a table, the hosts and the guests are equally responsible for a successful moment, so I make sure to play my part.<\/p><p><strong>What is the craziest project Bernardaud has ever been a part of? <\/strong><br\/>Most of the collaborations we make with artists are quite complex and innovative and give us the opportunity to push back the technical limits of porcelain. Recently the Diamond (Red) made with Jeff Koons was quite a challenge. Our best reward is when we manage to reach the artist’s requirements and to see him happy with the result that fits his vision.<\/p>",
