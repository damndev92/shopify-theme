We meet Milly Hibbert, head of brand and retail development to discuss the family-run business, sustainability, and why we all need to “take the Thyme”.<\/p>",

We moved here as a family in 2001 and acquired a collection of historic, agricultural buildings that had been forgotten and fallen into a state of complete disrepair. The ambition was to breathe new life into these old working buildings, preserving their huge internal spaces and reconnecting them with the land and farm. Over the next 10 years, Thyme began to unfold and grow, and while it changed, the ethos has never faltered.The name ‘Thyme’ was chosen because it is a culinary, medicinal and aromatic herb, but also it is about slowing down. Thyme still embodies that ethos, to ‘take Thyme’, to enjoy the moment and to reconnect with nature.  A stay at Thyme is to be immersed in the English countryside, to experience our love of the land, nature and the seasons in all their glory from the flowers, fruit and vegetables that grace our tables to the flora and fauna that inhabit our farm and wild spaces. <\/p>",
