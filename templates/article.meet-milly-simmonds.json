As a small child, I would always ask my mum if I could lay the table and make it “extra special”. I would dig out her pretty linens, pick flowers from the garden and make little floral displays along the table, tie ribbons around napkins and design name cards and menus! I loved it. This started at the age of 6!<\/p><p>The business organically grew into a shop, as lots of our clients were asking if they could purchase products we were using for styling. I had always dreamt of having a shop and designing one-of-a-kind pieces that are special to keep forever.<\/p><p>Describe your aesthetic in three words.<\/p><p>Natural, effortless & elegant.<\/p>",

It’s a little rugged, as we’ve been so relaxed with kids drawing on it and the odd glass of red spilling on it, but it does tell a few stories! I like unfussy things that I don’t have to be precious about. I also love our boucle cream chair from Soho Home. It’s the perfect spot for reading by the fire.<\/p><p>You can only stay in one hotel for the rest of your life. Where are you checking in?<\/p><p>Baglio Occhipinti in Sicily.

You see the same details on clothes that you do in homes. Think about detailed embroidery or the use of materials like leather and silk. Fashion designers are working with design brands more than ever right now. Fashion and design follow a very similar creative process. They are both influenced by travel, culture and what’s happening in the world.<\/p><p><strong>As a ‘maker’ what is good taste for you? How about bad?<\/strong><\/p><p>Good: a nice mix of materials, a flowing colour palette to create the right mood, comfortable yet stylish furniture and GOOD LIGHTING! Lots of table lamps and no overhead lights unless they’re on a dimmer. Special pieces from travels always go a long way, as does natural flooring like solid wood or sea grass. Ambience is everything!<\/p><p>Bad: bright overhead lights are a massive no-no. Uninteresting colours are lacklustre; think all grey everything…  grey walls, grey furniture, grey linens.
