As a small child, I would always ask my mum if I could lay the table and make it “extra special”. I would dig out her pretty linens, pick flowers from the garden and make little floral displays along the table, tie ribbons around napkins and design name cards and menus! I loved it. This started at the age of 6!<\/p><p>The business organically grew into a shop, as lots of our clients were asking if they could purchase products we were using for styling. I had always dreamt of having a shop and designing one-of-a-kind pieces that are special to keep forever.<\/p><p>Describe your aesthetic in three words.<\/p><p>Natural, effortless & elegant.<\/p>",
