Living in London in between and returning back to Istanbul, I worked as a journalist for CNN Turkey. Being passionate about storytelling and cross-cultural relationships, I worked in the fields of news, marketing in communications before launching Anim – a lifestyle brand with a focus on home textiles.<\/p><p><strong>How did you start Anim Living?<\/strong><br\/>It really was about sticking back to my roots I would say. I really wanted to create a new generation lifestyle brand with a main focus on home textiles. I come from a family of textile origins, both from my mother’s and my father’s side. While I had no intention of working at textiles when I was a child, I started realizing there wasn’t much of a home textiles brand with a young and cool spirit, that would actually excite people. I really wanted to create something that would make people happy and excited, while staying true to such values of being rooted in quality, cultural responsibility, and sustainability. Design and craftsmanship with beautiful fabrics and items made to last a lifetime at the core of Anim, it really is an exciting journey to create. Home is all we have, and the confinement period during COVID has proved this as well. I truly believe in the unique approach of Anim towards home textiles – and more.<\/p>",
