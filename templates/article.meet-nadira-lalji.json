Upon entering the hotel, given its open plan layout and winding corridors through buildings, you do not immediately notice the distinctions between the houses, which were first connected in the Seventies. We reconsidered floor and ceiling treatments to be sensitive to the original buildings and delineate their positions. The buildings were gutted prior to our acquisition of the site; sadly, in spite of its listed status, much of the interior fabric of the hotel had been destroyed. <\/p><p><em>2) Formerly a nightclub…<\/em><br\/>25 Southwick Street was previously the site of Zebra Club, a restaurant, bar and nightclub. While the club was not somewhere we frequented, or know much about, we are certain that the current wellness-focused hotel and its serene spaces are quite the transformation and juxtaposition, given the building’s past life and former red-light-district locale.<\/p><p><em>3) Art gallery credentials…<\/em><br\/>Many hotels resort to prints and off-the-shelf art. Art was a major consideration for the property: we collaborated with around several dozen artists, in partnership with Anne Rogers from Culture A. Roughly half of our artists are based in the UK; others hail from the USA, Japan, Denmark, Bulgaria, Germany and France.<\/p>",
