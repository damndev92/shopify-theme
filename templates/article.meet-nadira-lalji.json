        "text_block": "<p><strong>Can you share three interesting facts about Inhabit?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong><br\/><\/strong><em>1) Originally six homes…<\/em><br\/>Inhabit occupies six, formerly residential Georgian townhouses. Upon entering the hotel, given its open plan layout and winding corridors through buildings, you do not immediately notice the distinctions between the houses, which were first connected in the Seventies. We reconsidered floor and ceiling treatments to be sensitive to the original buildings and delineate their positions. The buildings were gutted prior to our acquisition of the site; sadly, in spite of its listed status, much of the interior fabric of the hotel had been destroyed. <\/p><p><em>2) Formerly a nightclub…<\/em><br\/>25 Southwick Street was previously the site of Zebra Club, a restaurant, bar and nightclub. While the club was not somewhere we frequented, or know much about, we are certain that the current wellness-focused hotel and its serene spaces are quite the transformation and juxtaposition, given the building’s past life and former red-light-district locale.<\/p><p><em>3) Art gallery credentials…<\/em><br\/>Many hotels resort to prints and off-the-shelf art. Art was a major consideration for the property: we collaborated with around several dozen artists, in partnership with Anne Rogers from Culture A. Roughly half of our artists are based in the UK; others hail from the USA, Japan, Denmark, Bulgaria, Germany and France.<\/p>",

        "text_block": "<p>In a continuation of Inhabit’s ethos of mindfulness and wellness, we curated a holistic art programme for the guest rooms and public areas to engage guests in a multi- disciplinary art experience that celebrates Inhabit’s mission, London sensibility and Scandinavian style.<br\/><br\/>We have 440 pieces of art in the hotel: 204 artworks in communal areas and corridors, and 236 in guest rooms. Our artworks follow six curatorial themes that we felt represented wellbeing for our guests and wellbeing for the wider world, including <em>Lucky Life<\/em> (embrace opportunity), <em>Supernatural<\/em> (connect with vivid nature), <em>Mindful Escape<\/em> (meditate; reflect; repeat), <em>Interconnectivity<\/em> (it’s all relative), and <em>Peaceful Play<\/em> (be in the moment).  <\/p><p>Our art programme is an example of our overriding commitment, as a hotel brand, to promote local and international culture. The programme features a mix of emerging and established artists working in a variety of mediums, including textile, metal, painting, and photography. Our hope is that the experience inspires guests to reflect on their surroundings in the context of Inhabit’s ethos, while also connecting with the works and each other through the inclusive, universal language of art. <\/p><p><strong>What inspired the name of the hotel?<\/strong><br\/><\/p><p>I read a few books about mindfulness, <em>lagom<\/em> and <em>hygge<\/em>: all concepts that explore the idea of comfort and, most importantly for me, comfort in the quotidian – our day-to-day living and routine. As I read these books, I kept an eye on words, marking up the books as I leafed through them, and ‘inhabit’ kept surfacing and summarised it for me and our team.<\/p>",
