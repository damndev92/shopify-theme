It actually means “Japanese Cow”<br\/>and I created the first-ever Kobe Beef Prosciutto for which I won the Wallpaper design awards a few years ago.<\/p><p><strong>How do you approach the interior design in each location?<\/strong><br\/>I get inspired by the setting of each location and develop the brand around it. I work with Humbert & Poyet since day one. We grew together.<\/p>",
