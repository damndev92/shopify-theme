The stately building has been reborn thanks to the inspired efforts of a passionate team of local architects and designers. The ornate baroque mansion lived through the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the rule of Russian czars, Napoleon’s entrance to Vilnius, and the Soviet before it was reborn in 2018 as the Hotel PACAI.  Rich historic elements are masterfully blended with present-day design to showcase soft, deep tones and elegant materials that heighten the structure’s classical style. <\/p>",

Money was not the case, he said, just tell the price. Very Maison Flâneur. <\/p><p><strong>What makes a good hotel? <\/strong><\/p><p>Authentic experience (be it architecture, design, food, spa moments, details in the room, welcome note) and genuine hospitality – employees who do their work with passion.<\/p>",

It celebrates the region’s tradition as well as the present uniqueness of Lithuanian and Baltic culture. With the majority of the mansion’s spaces dating back centuries, the designers’ goal was to keep the history visible in a direct way. Thus, all the existing frescoes and unique textures of the walls are emphasized through lighting. While the main features of the hotel strive for elegance and classical purity, both through materials and details. A cozy, artistic atmosphere includes soft, deep tones in the public areas and artwork in the rooms.<\/p>",

All this makes the room special and different.<\/p><p><strong>Is there an object in the hotel that has a special meaning for you? <\/strong><\/p><p>Athena – a sculpture of 17th century greets you on the second floor.
