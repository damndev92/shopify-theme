Tell us a little bit more about what that was like.<\/strong><\/p><p>It means no holidays, no family time a lot of work and always swimming against the current. That made me stronger. It gave me the chance to grow up in an enormous melting pot of different people, cultures, habits, languages and religions, which made me completely open-minded. It allowed me to build an incredible network of people with no borders. The line between family, friends and guests disappears.<\/p>",

What makes it so different?<\/strong><\/p><p>Switzerland was very famous for its traditional hôtellerie, but I couldn’t see myself in this formative but prescriptive environment. I felt the need to create a place where nature, design, taste (food) and a sense of home meet. The soul, spirit and energy flow from hotel to guest and guest to hotel. This is not merely a concept or a vision but a tangible reality.<\/p>",

It’s the most intimate relationship we can have with our guests. We developed this ‘Alpine Cuisine’ over the years, incorporating new ingredients as we discovered them.<\/p><p><strong>And finally can you tell us a little about what is so special about the energy at Chetzeron?<\/strong><\/p><p>Before acquiring the building, I called in Taoist Chinese monks, experts in feng shui, to study the building, its spaces and energies.
