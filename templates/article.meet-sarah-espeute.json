        "text": "<p>Sarah Espeute is a French Artist-Designer who uses everyday imagery to tell familiar stories through functional yet aesthetically charming textiles. Along with her repurposing of timeless imagery, she sustains traditional methods of embroidery passed down through families for generations. Through this, her work emulates and explores the tender relationship between dining and cherished moments with family and friends. We had the pleasure of speaking with Espeute to learn more about the origins and inspiration for her brand, Oeuvres Sensibles.<\/p>",
