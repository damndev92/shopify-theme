It’s simple moments, tools, objects that change a moment from ordinary to extraordinary. Dada’s spirit, taken from the art movement itself, is not about convention or proper – it’s about creating decadence in one’s daily moments; moments that will bring you joy and inspiration, moments that will bring people together to be creative and ignite the senses.<em> <\/em><\/p>",

One shouldn’t feel overwhelmed or insecure – whether you’re entertaining yourself, your loved ones or your sense, DADA was meant to be used anytime and anywhere to effortlessly create a magical hour of the ordinary moment.<\/p>",

I remember that loves the marriage of the masculinity of the chair, big tough and secure but mixed with these curvy voluptuous lines that resembled a woman.  I searched the internet and found a tiny gold one and blew way more money than I should have on it. It still sits on my shelf in my apartment and will always be one of my favourite purchases.<\/p><p>Anyway, I wanted the ashtray to convey those same feelings – and while it isn’t made JUST for smoking “butts” – I did want it to conjure up the visual of smoking; the sexy, bygone era, where smoking was cool. Cowboy, bombshell, European, all American, sad, disco…. Pretty much everything real. Long story short, I wanted people to feel that heartbreak I had at the turn of my teenage years and say, “I need to have that.”<\/p><p><\/p>",
