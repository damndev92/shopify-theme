        "text": "<p>We couldn’t wait for you to meet Valentine Pozzo di Borgo. The Parisian perfumer and dynamic entrepreneur inherited her love of perfume. Xavier Givaudan, her grandfather was a chemist from Lyon living in Switzerland, engraved his name in 1895 in the history of world perfumery by founding the homonymous group and by discovering many molecules, such as Lila 7. Her childhood memories are all associated with a perfume: the flasks in the office-laboratory, the long walks in the Swiss mountains and the Corsican maquis, the hours spent in perfumeries smelling new things … By composing olfactory universes, she perpetuates the family tradition while giving it a touch of femininity and modernity. We are so proud to showcase some of her creation and for you to discover more of her universe.<\/p>",

First, I decided to dedicate myself to BtoB clients: creating olfactive identity for customers that had no access to the perfume world. This activity is called Quintessence Lab. I wanted to pursue a family tradition as my family has been in the perfume industry for almost 5 generations. Perfume was somehow in my blood. <br\/>Then 2 years later, Quintessence Paris was launched as I wanted to open to a new clientele.<\/p><p><strong>There is a history of perfume in your family?<\/strong><br\/>Yes! I a descendant of the Givaudan family. They were chemists who created the first synthetic smells. They invented Lilac for example. The company that they created is still operational today. They sold it in the ’60s but <em>Givaudan<\/em> still develops tastes and scents that delight consumers all over the world.<\/p><p><strong>Do you remember your first memory of a scent? <\/strong><br\/>My first memory is associated with a place. The perfume of this moment is not describable as it is a mix of fragrance. It was vials in her grandfather’s laboratory.<\/p>",
