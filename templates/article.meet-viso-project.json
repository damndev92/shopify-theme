We aim at creating distinct design objects crafted by expert artisans and manufacturers around the world.<\/p><p>David Vivirido and Francesco Sourigues founded the brand after working for 15 years in the world of publishing, editing, and consulting for luxury brands. It was time for them to take a detour into the world of design. With a fun and vibrant approach, including patterns, textures, and finishings, VISO Project injects a sophisticated and meaningful aesthetic twist into the world of decor and gifting.<\/p>",
