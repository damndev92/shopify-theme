Specifically at my grandmother’s house, with all my relatives eating together and playing with my cousins… It’s still all here in my mind!<\/p><p><strong>Hospitality is very much in your veins. Can you tell us a little bit about your family history here on Santorini?<\/strong><br\/>My parents owned a tourist office and also built and rented bungalows in the 1980s. One of those bungalows was our home, so I practically grew up in a hotel. In a way, I was trained in all roles in hospitality without knowing it. And at this time, you could still find a pure kind of Greek hospitality. After my father got sick and died, I took over the family business, started changing it, and slowly growing my own companies on the island, all of them related to hospitality, and all promoting the island in its best light. My grandfather taught me that if you love and respect Santorini, then Santorini will be generous to you. That’s why I promote local cuisine and products, as well as the culture, architecture, and the local ways of doing things.<\/p>",
