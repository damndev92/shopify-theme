The two boutique hotels, TRUNK(HOTEL) and TRUNK(HOUSE) that I opened are extremely highly praised all over the world and have received numerous international awards. And this is only the beginning: I’m currently planning new venue openings in Tokyo.<br\/>I’m also the founder of Take and Give Needs, the bridal company that has developed and broadened the concept of “House Wedding” in Japan. According to this success, the company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section since 2006. <br\/>People often mention me as one of the leading entrepreneurs of Japan, and it makes me extremely glad.<\/p>",

It’s chaos. There is such a diversity of persons, identities in Shibuya that you can really feel excited just by crossing the path of someone. This is probably the reason why yesterday as today new cultures emerge from Shibuya.<\/p>",

On the other hand, global customers are becoming more and more diverse, and it is true that this booming diversity of demands is challenging the services we shall deliver.<br\/>In this context, I’m convinced it is essential to precisely identify your target and focus on it. Rather than trying to provide a bunch of services that can satisfy all customers, I’d better concentrate on designing a service that matches your core target. (it implies of course that the quality of hospitality responds fundamentally to all our guests).<br\/>I believe the variety of means, types, and shapes of hospitality should evolve with the evolving demands of today’s customers, and that what I’m exploring every day.<br\/>TRUNK targets people that are ‘lifestyle connoisseurs’, with a high receptivity to experience and <em>bon goût<\/em>. I assume those people will not be satisfied with a preconditioned package of services. That’s why I do not bound my employees with a staff handbook and encourage them to think and act by themselves.<br\/>For instance, they can organize spontaneously some activities following one guest request by activating their personal network; they can enjoy karaoke with guests; leave the front desk and accompany them into the deep town bar areas; go surfing on (guest) demand. With this open-minded and flexible TRUNK likely customer relationship, we ensure each of our guests complete satisfaction.<\/p>",

Overseas also, there are various examples of towns and districts metamorphosis due to the birth of one hotel. In the early 2000, think about Soho House NY in Meatpacking, New York, or Shoreditch House that has completely transformed Shoreditch neighbourhood in London.<br\/>Initially, this location suffered from a pretty bad reputation but with the opening of TRUNK(HOTEL), attractive restaurants, cafés, and offices blossomed, and the area is now perceived as an epicenter of creativity. Where’s next? Japanese major real estate developers are keeping their eyes fixed on us.<br\/>In addition, we score very high regarding employee satisfaction. Despite being still a young company founded only 4 years ago, we reach amazingly great scores in employee satisfaction surveys compared to other companies. Especially when you look at the categories of vision and mission understanding and engagement the rates are extremely high. Having every single employee delivering the best to achieve our same goal, this is a fact I’m so proud of.<\/p>",
