And it’s unsurprising, given founders Jeremy and Cath’s move to Devon – away from their successful careers in the UN and architecture respectively – was fuelled by a need to slow down. After experimenting at home with shapes, materials and styles (their first piece was a ‘wonky’ coffee mug designed to better fit the hand), and developing a love for hand-shaping practical pieces, Feldspar was born. The pair now run their globally sold brand from their own studio in Devon, where they live with their two children and dog Bernard.<br\/><br\/>They’re on a mission to create objects for life, made to last – fusing traditional techniques with modern life and style. And their craft – which is listed as critically endangered by the Heritage Crafts Association in the UK – has been honed to preserve an English skill while also providing high quality, handmade homeware. Each piece is made using the ‘slip casting’ method, and their bone china collections are minimal in aesthetic yet never perfect and polished – preferring asymmetrical shapes and imperfect silhouettes over identical, cookie cutter bowls and plates. Gold and richly coloured rims are their signature look, which makes for dinnerware and drinkware that’s ideal for elevating your next dinner party or date night at home.<br\/><\/p>",
