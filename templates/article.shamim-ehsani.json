Our intention was to break away from the colonial-era inspired design and service culture, and to introduce a more contemporary offering, which would appeal to the global creative community and travelers in our own demographic. We achieved this through a beautifully curated collection of art and a radically different approah to service, showcasing true African talent and benchmarking ourselves against the best examples of hospitality globally.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Can you tell us something about Tribe that people might not know about?<\/strong><\/p><p>Our collection of over 900 art pieces took 5 years to collect and curate.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Can you tell us something about Nairobi that people might not know about?<\/strong><\/p><p>Nairobi is the only capital city in the world with a national park in its city limits and is also home to Karura Forest, one of largest urban forests in the world.<\/p>",
