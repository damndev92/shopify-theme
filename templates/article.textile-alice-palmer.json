Alice struggled to find lampshades that were affordable, versatile, and beautiful. She always loved the homely feel that loose and frilly fabric styles can bring to a room, so she decided to make her own, finding the right frame shape she liked, sourcing the right supplier, and making some samples. Alice Palmer & Co was born. <\/p><p>Each of her shades showcases an exquisite fabric, often sourced during, or inspired by, her travels; From traditional British homes, colonial Caribbean villas, and Andalusian haciendas. <\/p><p>We are so happy to offer you a selection of her products, which will light up your home.<\/p>",
