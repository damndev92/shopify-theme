Before the talented makers at Georges even begin to begin shaping and molding the fixture of the petal lampss, the materials must be sourced and selected. The team thumbs through their enormous library of materials – Lyonnaise silk, Pyrenean wool, their own wood – and selects something that’s just right. Then, guided by these materials, the artisans let things unfold organically, creating things that seem as if they could have existed all along.<\/p><p>Should cotton be the order of the day, the team has beautiful Normandy cotton to hand. The Georges wool is sourced from a beautiful sheep farm in the Pyrenees or from the Valgaudemar Valley in the Hautes-Alpes. The shepherds weave the wool by hand before passing it over to Mylene and her team, so they receive only the finest.<\/p><p>Lyonnaise silk is also a favourite material at Georges, though antique linens abound as well. The linen collection is an ever-growing one, as the team picks up bits and bobs from brocantes and surplus stores year after year. From the Pyrenees-Atlantiques to the Haute-Pyrenees to the Haute Garonne, all corners of France afford Georges with the opportunity to uncover treasures.<\/p>",

Whether they’re producing subtly scented candles, elegant stools, sweeping light fixtures or earthy linens, a thread of continuity runs through their work. Each piece is pure, distilled down to its most essential form, and crafted to feel as if it sprung from the earth naturally. <\/p><p>They make their own magical potions, brewing flour, and natural pigments together to create the paint they’ll use to colour the cotton. Bordeaux, ochres, indigo and pastels are also used to hand-dye the cotton, ensuring rich yet subtle hues for all.<\/p><p>The table is crafted from Orriule stoneware. While more complicated pieces are produced using ecological materials. The team honors the natural state of their materials, leaving them in their rawest form or treating them gently (hand-dyeing, polishing with steel wool to restore shine).<\/p>",

Why look elsewhere when you can do it better and more beautifully at home?<\/p><p>Once the team creates their paints and dyes from scratch, they prepare their fabrics for colouration. They carefully paint or dye the fabrics, leaving some in their unadulterated states, and then allow them to dry. After they’ve dried fully, the fabrics are ready for the next steps.<\/p><p>On the first floor of the castle, the artisans work with brass and wood. The end product dictates the technique used, but they are wide-ranging and require immense skill. The team presses, drills, wets, and soaks to tame the raw materials. This union of man and nature allows them to form the petals for the signature Georges petal fixtures.<\/p><p>Next comes cutting and gluing. Though they may sound simple, these techniques become deceptively precise when in the hands of Georges artisans. The team tackles each step meticulously. They spread out to ensure everything is exact. Proper scissors and a good brush are key.<\/p><p>Though it is a detailed and lengthy process of creation, the care and attention are worth it. The beauty and delicacy of the Georges petals lamps are proof positive. <\/p>",
