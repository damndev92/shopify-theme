Before the talented makers at Georges even begin to begin shaping and molding the fixture of the petal lampss, the materials must be sourced and selected. The team thumbs through their enormous library of materials – Lyonnaise silk, Pyrenean wool, their own wood – and selects something that’s just right. Then, guided by these materials, the artisans let things unfold organically, creating things that seem as if they could have existed all along.<\/p><p>Should cotton be the order of the day, the team has beautiful Normandy cotton to hand. The Georges wool is sourced from a beautiful sheep farm in the Pyrenees or from the Valgaudemar Valley in the Hautes-Alpes. The shepherds weave the wool by hand before passing it over to Mylene and her team, so they receive only the finest.<\/p><p>Lyonnaise silk is also a favourite material at Georges, though antique linens abound as well. The linen collection is an ever-growing one, as the team picks up bits and bobs from brocantes and surplus stores year after year. From the Pyrenees-Atlantiques to the Haute-Pyrenees to the Haute Garonne, all corners of France afford Georges with the opportunity to uncover treasures.<\/p>",
