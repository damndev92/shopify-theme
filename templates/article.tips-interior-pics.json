You may want to take wide and close up shots of the same scene to show various aspects you want to show off.<\/p><p><strong>2.  Use a tripod<\/strong><\/p><p>Position your camera, if possible, on a tripod if the light is low to avoid blur images. Otherwise, push the ISO. It means the sensitivity of the captor.  For example On a DSLR move from 100 ISO to 800 ISO. It will allow you to have faster shutter speed without blurring images. It will allow you to have a deeper depth of field as well.Depth of field plays and creates mood but that is for another time if you’d like to know more!<\/p><p><strong>3. Style it up<\/strong><\/p><p>Once you are happy with the crop, do some styling:  like moving objects (Hence the use of a tripod !), adding flowers, creating a scene… Try not to use too much of a wide-angle unless really needed. It may put things too far away in the image and take away the wow factor. Avoid things too close the lens especially using a wide-angle as it may look deformed. A medium lens works better-creating intimacy.<\/p><p><strong>4.  Weather it out<\/strong><\/p><p>Set your camera on Automatic Daylight Balance. On a smartphone, it will do it automatically.  Automatic Daylight Balance will balance the light as you actually see it with your eyes. The weather can completely change the mood of an interior shot. Not better or worse just different. The sun brings strong lines and contrast. A grey dull day softness and lots of details. Some places will work both ways and some will work better in the sun. Try it out for yourself.<\/p>",
