The neighbourhood has always attracted bad boys and artists, musicians and adventurers. With neither a monument nor a meeting point, it lacked a spot that really reflected its tawdry values, brazen spirit and musical energy. And so, Le Pigalle was born. An authentic neighbourhood hotel, whose history was shaped by the cultural mix that swirls on the southern slopes of Montmartre.<\/p>","button_link":"","button_label":""}},"7322c4e1-3560-42f9-a9c6-6ee0710b286b":{"type":"image--gallery","blocks":{"template--17526727344443__7322c4e1-3560-42f9-a9c6-6ee0710b286b-16733517587c71d58c-0":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1.png","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/white-cotton-graphic-backpack-jean-andre-x-le-pigalle","title":"","description":""}},"template--17526727344443__7322c4e1-3560-42f9-a9c6-6ee0710b286b-16733517587c71d58c-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/2.png","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/parentesi-suspension-lamp","title":"","description":""}}},"block_order":["template--17526727344443__7322c4e1-3560-42f9-a9c6-6ee0710b286b-16733517587c71d58c-0","template--17526727344443__7322c4e1-3560-42f9-a9c6-6ee0710b286b-16733517587c71d58c-1"],"settings":{"colors":"light","subheading":"","title":""}},"63680a03-e85a-40a7-9084-4a83db4c7921":{"type":"image--gallery","blocks":{"4a6acbfc-e3bf-4241-befe-d155af3a0092":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5.png","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/white-cotton-graphic-tote-bag-jean-andre-x-le-pigalle","title":"","description":""}},"c2c6cee0-74ca-4a08-a2fb-344ad7d32db9":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/3.png","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/wall-lamp-applique-a-volant-pivotant-by-charlotte-perriand","title":"","description":""}},"a24f60ee-30f9-49a0-bc3e-a55a0b1a5c03":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4.png","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/white-cotton-graphic-t-shirt-le-pigalle","title":"","description":""}},"f28e3701-03ba-4ff9-a8f9-912d3945ff62":{"type":"image","disabled":true,"settings":{"link":"","title":"","description":""}}},"block_order":["4a6acbfc-e3bf-4241-befe-d155af3a0092","c2c6cee0-74ca-4a08-a2fb-344ad7d32db9","a24f60ee-30f9-49a0-bc3e-a55a0b1a5c03","f28e3701-03ba-4ff9-a8f9-912d3945ff62"],"settings":{"colors":"light","subheading":"","title":""}},"754b6613-99e2-4bfd-a95a-940c730e6bcd":{"type":"image--image-with-text-block","disabled":true,"settings":{"parallax":true,"text-color":"#000000","background-color":"#ffffff","horizontal-alignment":"center","subheading":"","title":"Meet the Interior Designers","text":"For Le Pigalle, renowned Parisian Interior Design Firm Festen took the original building and added typical Parisian touches, such as panelled doors and white walls, moulding, woodwork and parquet flooring.\n\nAs Hugo Sauzay, one of Festen’s partners says, “If you really look close at Pigalle, we’re actually in La Nouvelle Athenes, where the architecture is less uniform than elsewhere, and we’ve taken the essence of that with details such as curved bay windows, and the cheap, veined marble that was really popular in this faubourg, where people wanted to imitate the richer districts, so we’ve used that for the basins.
